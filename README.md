# KeyL

**Disclaimer:**  
This project of a Key Logger is for **educational purposes**. Use it **only** in controlled environments or virtual machines that you own. Do **not** deploy or use this code on any system without explicit permission from the owner. Misuse of this software may violate laws and going to jail it's dumb so use the brain.

This keylogger records keystrokes and saves them locally in a temporary file. When the number of captured keystrokes reaches a predefined threshold, the content is automatically sent to a Telegram bot controlled by the operator.

The bot also supports a remote command `/kill <machine_id>` which allows stopping the keylogger execution on a specific machine by remote.
